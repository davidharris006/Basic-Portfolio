        I have always had a passion for computers and what you do and create wit them, that is my main motivation for going into this career.  It has always excited me using computers as tools to help create thing for people. Growing up in my Father was always very interseted in computers and enjoyed building and using them; so natuarlly i gravitated towards computers as well.

    <p>  After Highschool I left San Diego and atteneded University of Califorina Riverside and recieved a degree in Economics.  Once I graduted I began a career as a Finacial Advisor, I obtained my Series 7 liscnese and was about to take my Series 66 for the second time when i decied I could not be a Finacial planner any more.  I now work for an online school as a Financial cousulor. This has given me lost of insite into what school really means to me and that I know that I want technology, especially computers, to play a big role in my next career.</p>
